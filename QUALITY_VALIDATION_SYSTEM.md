        'bullet_points': listing.bullet_points,
        'long_description': listing.long_description,
        'faqs': listing.faqs
    }
    
    quality_report = validator.get_validation_json(validation_data)
    
    # Store quality metrics
    listing.quality_score = quality_report['overall_score']
    listing.emotion_score = quality_report['emotion_score']
    listing.conversion_score = quality_report['conversion_score']
    listing.trust_score = quality_report['trust_score']
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Quality validation failed: {e}")
```

### 2. Standalone Validation API

const [qualityReport, setQualityReport] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
    if (listing.id) {
        fetch(`/api/listings/listings/${listing.id}/quality_report/`)
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => setQualityReport(data.validation_report));
